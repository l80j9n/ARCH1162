ARCH1162 Structures and Construction   1 -   2024
Assignment
PREAMBLE   As future architects it   is critical that you not   only   understand   how to   construct   your   designs but consider how the structure and   construction   can   contribute to   what   you   are   trying   to achieve. An   understanding of timber and   masonry construction   is a central   aim of this   course   as   is   being   aware of the   limitations of structure.
To successfully carry out this   project you will   need to observe   actual   buildings   being   built   or   already   built,   make   use of the various texts   referred to   in   handouts and   lectures; ask questions of yourselves,   fellow students and tutors as you work.   It will   be   important that you consider the different   possibilities   that   standard solutions offer and amend the solutions while   not compromising   the   pragmatic   reasoning      behind the standard solutions.
The   project   brief requires the design of a timber or   timber   and   masonry   structure. The   main   primary   and   secondary structure of you scheme   is to   be developed to a   level that   explains   how   it   could   be   built.
BRIEF   In ARCH   1101 – Architectural   Design Studio   1 you   have designed a   Fishing Club   and   Life
Saving Tower at Gordons   Bay. (If not discuss   with   your   tutor   to   make   alternate   arrangements).   During   this   course you are going to develop and change the   design through   a   series   of   exercises   exploring   the construction of the floors, wall and roof in timber   or timber   and   masonry.
The   idea   is that as the design changes you   make the design   not   only feasible   to   build   but   more         interesting. You are to use your new understanding   of   structures   and   construction   to   explore   the   aesthetic and pragmatic potentials of timber   and   masonry   construction.APROXIMATE SIZES      Surf   Life Saving Tower 20m2,   Fishing Club   30m2   and   Bathing   Facilities      25m2. The   Life Saving Tower   is for   up to three   people who are to have   uninterrupted views   across the         bay. The   Fishing Club requires some storage, two work   benches and   a   place   for   members   to   catch   up.
The   Bathing   Facilities are to   be   provided as   required and   may   be   largely outside.   SITE The site for your   building   is Gordons   Bay.   
PRESENTATION   REQUIREMENTS   For the assignment there are four components:   The   Logbook, Construction, Stability and Span Tables.
Logbook
1. Your   logbook is a   record of what you have   been   doing   both   in the tutorials   and   as   self-study.   Keep   a
record of all the work you have done   in the tutorials,   any   reflections you   have   on   the   lectures/   tutorials
(not   lecture   notes though) and any self study. Try and   explain why, what   and   how   things   are   done.   This   is   an opportunity for you to show us   how engaged you   are.
Construction
2. You are to   produce a 3D computer   model of all   the   main   structural   elements   used   in your   design.   This      can   be done   in sketch up or any   other   computer   program you   like. All   structural   elements   must   be   shown   including the following   if used: footings,   masonry   including cavity,   bearers, joists, studs, noggins, top plate,   bottom plate, posts, rafters,   beams,   battens and   stair   structure.
Stability
3. Consider the   lateral stability of your Gordon’s   Bay building.   Look   at   wind   actions   from   two   directions   in   plan and think about   the way your structure resists ac代 写ARCH1162 Structures and Construction 1 - 2024SQL
代做程序编程语言tions   that   tend   to   turn   rectangular   panels   into   parallelograms.   Employ one or several of the three stable   rectangle   methods   (diagonal   bracing,   ridged   frame. action or shear wall)   over all   levels from   roof to   foundation   to   achieve   stability   against   wind   from   either direction.
Consider the connections of your   building’s components and idealise the joints.   Show this   in   a   system   diagram including the forces.   Using two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional sketches, demonstrate   in   separate drawings viable   load   paths from each   point of application of each   of the   two   lateral   loads   at   the   top of the building to a footing at the ground.   In   separate   system   diagrams Also   show   the   action   effect   diagram of key structural elements   under the two   loads.An example   how this   looks for   part of a small   building   is   provided   below as   a   guide.   It   shows   a   picture   of   the   building, a simple 3D sketch with bracing, two   system   diagrams   in   elevations   showing   the   load   path      and a plan indicating the direction   of the forces. You   also   need to   provide   a   separate   sketch   with   the   action effect diagram of your own design.
4. Span tables
Even though all your designs are unique and   probably   don’t   strictly   comply   with   the   limitations   of AS1684   it   is   useful to understand span tables and the consequence   of your   design   choices   on   beam   sizes. You are to work out a typical floor joist size and   rafter for your   design. You   may   choose   any   grade   of timber.
Use the tables   in Acceptable Standards of Construction.   Ensure you also check the   notes   under the   span   tables.
Submission
1 Submit all of the above   in   one   pdf file   less   than   20Mb
2.   Logbook -   Include a scanned copy of your   logbook as   part   of the   pdf file
3. Construction   -   Include three views of your 3D computer   model   indicating the   parts as   outlined   in   point   one above.
4. Stability –   Provide:
- a system diagram either   in 3d or two   2d   sketches   showing the   proposed   loads.
- separate   load   path diagrams   including   the   load and system diagram for   each   load.
- seperate action effect diagrams   for   each   load
5. Span tables – Show the span tables selected to size   your   floor joists   and   rafters.   Indicate   on the   table   how you came to select the size   required.
For the   Floor joists note the roof load width, joist spacing,   roof type   and whether   the   floor joist   is   continuous or a   single   span.
For the   rafters   note   if a single or continuous span,   rafter   spacing,   if you   have   any   overhang   and what   roof   mass you   used.
Add notes under   both about   limitations and assumptions   plus   how you   addressed   any   of the   notes   on   the span table.
The submission   is to   be   made via the   link on   Moodle.
